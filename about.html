 <h2>About Page</h2>
<p>My name is Rachel, and I am from Florida. I have grown up around classic trucks/cars all my life. Started learning about how vehicles worked when I was 8 years old. First thing I ever worked on was my Dadâ€™s 1969 F-100. I am a huge fan of the classic vehicles and I know it can be struggle to keep up with all the classical cars out there much less car parts. I wanted to create a platform where the old souls can come together to help each other out in learning about classic cars or fixing them up. Hoping to inspire some people to get into the classic side of things.</p>
